# SVG Modification Sample

I had a client need where they wanted to update an image programatically. Once the logic was created I converted the image to an SVG and you can then use vanilla javascript or jQuery to modify the fill attributes with the path anchors to the desired color. The easiest way to implement this is to attach class attributes to similar colors and then modify those classes separately.
